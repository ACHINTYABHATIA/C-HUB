        <h1>About us - How we started?</h1>
        <p>
          C Park began its journey with a vision to revolutionize the way people
          experience parking in educational institutions. Founded by a team of
          passionate individuals, the company embarked on its mission to
          alleviate the stress associated with finding suitable parking spaces
          on busy campuses. The idea sparked from personal experiences, where
          the founders themselves faced challenges in securing parking spots at
          colleges. Determined to simplify this process, they pooled their
          expertise in technology and business to create an innovative solution.
          Through extensive research and dedication, C Park developed a
          user-friendly online platform that allows students, faculty, and
          visitors to reserve parking spaces in advance. The company's
          commitment to enhancing campus mobility and ensuring user convenience
          has been the driving force behind its growth. Today, C Park stands as
          a reliable partner for colleges, providing seamless and secure parking
          solutions to thousands of users, making campus life smoother and more
          enjoyable for everyone.
